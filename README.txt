Hello Morteza and Professor Shorser,

Hope you are doing well and staying safe.


Assumptions we have made:
The only assumption we make is that users will never abandon the system in the middle of a trade.
They will always enter whether or not they showed up to the meeting, or if they got stood up.

There are also limitations for how much money each person can input into the system.


For your ease, we have created test users and test items in the system. Please keep in mind that logging in is case sensitive.
Below are the credentials:
Super Admin:
Username: Tina
Password: 123456

Users:
Username: Tina - Password: 123 - items they own: shoe, ebook, sock, book
Username: Mo - Password: 123 - items they own: pen
Username: A -  Password: 123 - items they own: phone

The current system thresholds are as follows:
lentMinusBorrowedThreshold = 1
meetingEditThreshold = 3
weeklyTransactionLimit = 7
incompleteTransactionLimit = 3

Please note that UML.pdf and UML.png are identical (aside from file type).
